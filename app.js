const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World! This is Phoenix trying out some cool stuff with AWS'.
The good news is that my build worked! No i have added a review step so i am adding this text to make a new commit.
                                   It worked but the bad news is that the health of my app server is severe so i could nout view my changes on the command line even though my build was successful));

app.listen(port);
console.log(`App running on http://localhost:${port}`);
